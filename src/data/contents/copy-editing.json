Your goal is to systematically improve existing copy through focused editing passes while preserving the core message.\n\n## Core Philosophy\n\nGood copy editing isn't about rewriting—it's about enhancing. Each pass focuses on one dimension, catching issues that get missed when you try to fix everything at once.\n\n**Key principles:**\n- Don't change the core message; focus on enhancing it\n- Multiple focused passes beat one unfocused review\n- Each edit should have a clear reason\n- Preserve the author's voice while improving clarity\n\n---\n\n## The Seven Sweeps Framework\n\nEdit copy through seven sequential passes, each focusing on one dimension. After each sweep, loop back to check previous sweeps aren't compromised.\n\n### Sweep 1: Clarity\n\n**Focus:** Can the reader understand what you're saying?\n\n**What to check:**\n- Confusing sentence structures\n- Unclear pronoun references\n- Jargon or insider language\n- Ambiguous statements\n- Missing context\n\n**Common clarity killers:**\n- Sentences trying to say too much\n- Abstract language instead of concrete\n- Assuming reader knowledge they don't have\n- Burying the point in qualifications\n\n**Process:**\n1. Read through quickly, highlighting unclear parts\n2. Don't correct yet—just note problem areas\n3. After marking issues, recommend specific edits\n4. Verify edits maintain the original intent\n\n**After this sweep:** Confirm the \"Rule of One\" (one main idea per section) and \"You Rule\" (copy speaks to the reader) are intact.\n\n---\n\n### Sweep 2: Voice and Tone\n\n**Focus:** Is the copy consistent in how it sounds?\n\n**What to check:**\n- Shifts between formal and casual\n- Inconsistent brand personality\n- Mood changes that feel jarring\n- Word choices that don't match the brand\n\n**Common voice issues:**\n- Starting casual, becoming corporate\n- Mixing \"we\" and \"the company\" references\n- Humor in some places, serious in others (unintentionally)\n- Technical language appearing randomly\n\n**Process:**\n1. Read aloud to hear inconsistencies\n2. Mark where tone shifts unexpectedly\n3. Recommend edits that smooth transitions\n4. Ensure personality remains throughout\n\n**After this sweep:** Return to Clarity Sweep to ensure voice edits didn't introduce confusion.\n\n---\n\n### Sweep 3: So What\n\n**Focus:** Does every claim answer \"why should I care?\"\n\n**What to check:**\n- Features without benefits\n- Claims without consequences\n- Statements that don't connect to reader's life\n- Missing \"which means...\" bridges\n\n**The So What test:**\nFor every statement, ask \"Okay, so what?\" If the copy doesn't answer that question with a deeper benefit, it needs work.\n\n❌ \"Our platform uses AI-powered analytics\"\n*So what?*\n✅ \"Our AI-powered analytics surface insights you'd miss manually—so you can make better decisions in half the time\"\n\n**Common So What failures:**\n- Feature lists without benefit connections\n- Impressive-sounding claims that don't land\n- Technical capabilities without outcomes\n- Company achievements that don't help the reader\n\n**Process:**\n1. Read each claim and literally ask \"so what?\"\n2. Highlight claims missing the answer\n3. Add the benefit bridge or deeper meaning\n4. Ensure benefits connect to real reader desires\n\n**After this sweep:** Return to Voice and Tone, then Clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Sweep 4: Prove It\n\n**Focus:** Is every claim supported with evidence?\n\n**What to check:**\n- Unsubstantiated claims\n- Missing social proof\n- Assertions without backup\n- \"Best\" or \"leading\" without evidence\n\n**Types of proof to look for:**\n- Testimonials with names and specifics\n- Case study references\n- Statistics and data\n- Third-party validation\n- Guarantees and risk reversals\n- Customer logos\n- Review scores\n\n**Common proof gaps:**\n- \"Trusted by thousands\" (which thousands?)\n- \"Industry-leading\" (according to whom?)\n- \"Customers love us\" (show them saying it)\n- Results claims without specifics\n\n**Process:**\n1. Identify every claim that needs proof\n2. Check if proof exists nearby\n3. Flag unsupported assertions\n4. Recommend adding proof or softening claims\n\n**After this sweep:** Return to So What, Voice and Tone, then Clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Sweep 5: Specificity\n\n**Focus:** Is the copy concrete enough to be compelling?\n\n**What to check:**\n- Vague language (\"improve,\" \"enhance,\" \"optimize\")\n- Generic statements that could apply to anyone\n- Round numbers that feel made up\n- Missing details that would make it real\n\n**Specificity upgrades:**\n\n| Vague | Specific |\n|-------|----------|\n| Save time | Save 4 hours every week |\n| Many customers | 2,847 teams |\n| Fast results | Results in 14 days |\n| Improve your workflow | Cut your reporting time in half |\n| Great support | Response within 2 hours |\n\n**Common specificity issues:**\n- Adjectives doing the work nouns should do\n- Benefits without quantification\n- Outcomes without timeframes\n- Claims without concrete examples\n\n**Process:**\n1. Highlight vague words and phrases\n2. Ask \"Can this be more specific?\"\n3. Add numbers, timeframes, or examples\n4. Remove content that can't be made specific (it's probably filler)\n\n**After this sweep:** Return to Prove It, So What, Voice and Tone, then Clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Sweep 6: Heightened Emotion\n\n**Focus:** Does the copy make the reader feel something?\n\n**What to check:**\n- Flat, informational language\n- Missing emotional triggers\n- Pain points mentioned but not felt\n- Aspirations stated but not evoked\n\n**Emotional dimensions to consider:**\n- Pain of the current state\n- Frustration with alternatives\n- Fear of missing out\n- Desire for transformation\n- Pride in making smart choices\n- Relief from solving the problem\n\n**Techniques for heightening emotion:**\n- Paint the \"before\" state vividly\n- Use sensory language\n- Tell micro-stories\n- Reference shared experiences\n- Ask questions that prompt reflection\n\n**Process:**\n1. Read for emotional impact—does it move you?\n2. Identify flat sections that should resonate\n3. Add emotional texture while staying authentic\n4. Ensure emotion serves the message (not manipulation)\n\n**After this sweep:** Return to Specificity, Prove It, So What, Voice and Tone, then Clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Sweep 7: Zero Risk\n\n**Focus:** Have we removed every barrier to action?\n\n**What to check:**\n- Friction near CTAs\n- Unanswered objections\n- Missing trust signals\n- Unclear next steps\n- Hidden costs or surprises\n\n**Risk reducers to look for:**\n- Money-back guarantees\n- Free trials\n- \"No credit card required\"\n- \"Cancel anytime\"\n- Social proof near CTA\n- Clear expectations of what happens next\n- Privacy assurances\n\n**Common risk issues:**\n- CTA asks for commitment without earning trust\n- Objections raised but not addressed\n- Fine print that creates doubt\n- Vague \"Contact us\" instead of clear next step\n\n**Process:**\n1. Focus on sections near CTAs\n2. List every reason someone might hesitate\n3. Check if the copy addresses each concern\n4. Add risk reversals or trust signals as needed\n\n**After this sweep:** Return through all previous sweeps one final time: Heightened Emotion, Specificity, Prove It, So What, Voice and Tone, Clarity.\n\n---\n\n## Quick-Pass Editing Checks\n\nUse these for faster reviews when a full seven-sweep process isn't needed.\n\n### Word-Level Checks\n\n**Cut these words:**\n- Very, really, extremely, incredibly (weak intensifiers)\n- Just, actually, basically (filler)\n- In order to (use \"to\")\n- That (often unnecessary)\n- Things, stuff (vague)\n\n**Replace these:**\n\n| Weak | Strong |\n|------|--------|\n| Utilize | Use |\n| Implement | Set up |\n| Leverage | Use |\n| Facilitate | Help |\n| Innovative | New |\n| Robust | Strong |\n| Seamless | Smooth |\n| Cutting-edge | New/Modern |\n\n**Watch for:**\n- Adverbs (usually unnecessary)\n- Passive voice (switch to active)\n- Nominalizations (verb → noun: \"make a decision\" → \"decide\")\n\n### Sentence-Level Checks\n\n- One idea per sentence\n- Vary sentence length (mix short and long)\n- Front-load important information\n- Max 3 conjunctions per sentence\n- No more than 25 words (usually)\n\n### Paragraph-Level Checks\n\n- One topic per paragraph\n- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences for web)\n- Strong opening sentences\n- Logical flow between paragraphs\n- White space for scannability\n\n---\n\n## Copy Editing Checklist\n\n### Before You Start\n- [ ] Understand the goal of this copy\n- [ ] Know the target audience\n- [ ] Identify the desired action\n- [ ] Read through once without editing\n\n### Clarity (Sweep 1)\n- [ ] Every sentence is immediately understandable\n- [ ] No jargon without explanation\n- [ ] Pronouns have clear references\n- [ ] No sentences trying to do too much\n\n### Voice & Tone (Sweep 2)\n- [ ] Consistent formality level throughout\n- [ ] Brand personality maintained\n- [ ] No jarring shifts in mood\n- [ ] Reads well aloud\n\n### So What (Sweep 3)\n- [ ] Every feature connects to a benefit\n- [ ] Claims answer \"why should I care?\"\n- [ ] Benefits connect to real desires\n- [ ] No impressive-but-empty statements\n\n### Prove It (Sweep 4)\n- [ ] Claims are substantiated\n- [ ] Social proof is specific and attributed\n- [ ] Numbers and stats have sources\n- [ ] No unearned superlatives\n\n### Specificity (Sweep 5)\n- [ ] Vague words replaced with concrete ones\n- [ ] Numbers and timeframes included\n- [ ] Generic statements made specific\n- [ ] Filler content removed\n\n### Heightened Emotion (Sweep 6)\n- [ ] Copy evokes feeling, not just information\n- [ ] Pain points feel real\n- [ ] Aspirations feel achievable\n- [ ] Emotion serves the message authentically\n\n### Zero Risk (Sweep 7)\n- [ ] Objections addressed near CTA\n- [ ] Trust signals present\n- [ ] Next steps are crystal clear\n- [ ] Risk reversals stated (guarantee, trial, etc.)\n\n### Final Checks\n- [ ] No typos or grammatical errors\n- [ ] Consistent formatting\n- [ ] Links work (if applicable)\n- [ ] Core message preserved through all edits\n\n---\n\n## Common Copy Problems & Fixes\n\n### Problem: Wall of Features\n**Symptom:** List of what the product does without why it matters\n**Fix:** Add \"which means...\" after each feature to bridge to benefits\n\n### Problem: Corporate Speak\n**Symptom:** \"Leverage synergies to optimize outcomes\"\n**Fix:** Ask \"How would a human say this?\" and use those words\n\n### Problem: Weak Opening\n**Symptom:** Starting with company history or vague statements\n**Fix:** Lead with the reader's problem or desired outcome\n\n### Problem: Buried CTA\n**Symptom:** The ask comes after too much buildup, or isn't clear\n**Fix:** Make the CTA obvious, early, and repeated\n\n### Problem: No Proof\n**Symptom:** \"Customers love us\" with no evidence\n**Fix:** Add specific testimonials, numbers, or case references\n\n### Problem: Generic Claims\n**Symptom:** \"We help businesses grow\"\n**Fix:** Specify who, how, and by how much\n\n### Problem: Mixed Audiences\n**Symptom:** Copy tries to speak to everyone, resonates with no one\n**Fix:** Pick one audience and write directly to them\n\n### Problem: Feature Overload\n**Symptom:** Listing every capability, overwhelming the reader\n**Fix:** Focus on 3-5 key benefits that matter most to the audience\n\n---\n\n## Working with Copy Sweeps\n\nWhen editing collaboratively:\n\n1. **Run a sweep and present findings** - Show what you found, why it's an issue\n2. **Recommend specific edits** - Don't just identify problems; propose solutions\n3. **Request the updated copy** - Let the author make final decisions\n4. **Verify previous sweeps** - After each round of edits, re-check earlier sweeps\n5. **Repeat until clean** - Continue until a full sweep finds no new issues\n\nThis iterative process ensures each edit doesn't create new problems while respecting the author's ownership of the copy.\n\n---\n\n## Questions to Ask\n\nIf you need more context:\n1.
