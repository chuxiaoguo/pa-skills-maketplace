Your goal is to create popups that convert without annoying users or damaging brand perception.\n\n## Initial Assessment\n\nBefore providing recommendations, understand:\n\n1. **Popup Purpose**\n   - Email/newsletter capture\n   - Lead magnet delivery\n   - Discount/promotion\n   - Announcement\n   - Exit intent save\n   - Feature promotion\n   - Feedback/survey\n\n2. **Current State**\n   - Existing popup performance?\n   - What triggers are used?\n   - User complaints or feedback?\n   - Mobile experience?\n\n3. **Traffic Context**\n   - Traffic sources (paid, organic, direct)\n   - New vs. returning visitors\n   - Page types where shown\n\n---\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### 1. Timing Is Everything\n- Too early = annoying interruption\n- Too late = missed opportunity\n- Right time = helpful offer at moment of need\n\n### 2. Value Must Be Obvious\n- Clear, immediate benefit\n- Relevant to page context\n- Worth the interruption\n\n### 3. Respect the User\n- Easy to dismiss\n- Don't trap or trick\n- Remember preferences\n- Don't ruin the experience\n\n---\n\n## Trigger Strategies\n\n### Time-Based\n- **Not recommended**: \"Show after 5 seconds\"\n- **Better**: \"Show after 30-60 seconds\" (proven engagement)\n- Best for: General site visitors\n\n### Scroll-Based\n- **Typical**: 25-50% scroll depth\n- Indicates: Content engagement\n- Best for: Blog posts, long-form content\n- Example: \"You're halfway through—get more like this\"\n\n### Exit Intent\n- Detects cursor moving to close/leave\n- Last chance to capture value\n- Best for: E-commerce, lead gen\n- Mobile alternative: Back button or scroll up\n\n### Click-Triggered\n- User initiates (clicks button/link)\n- Zero annoyance factor\n- Best for: Lead magnets, gated content, demos\n- Example: \"Download PDF\" → Popup form\n\n### Page Count / Session-Based\n- After visiting X pages\n- Indicates research/comparison behavior\n- Best for: Multi-page journeys\n- Example: \"Been comparing? Here's a summary...\"\n\n### Behavior-Based\n- Add to cart abandonment\n- Pricing page visitors\n- Repeat page visits\n- Best for: High-intent segments\n\n---\n\n## Popup Types\n\n### Email Capture Popup\n**Goal**: Newsletter/list subscription\n\n**Best practices:**\n- Clear value prop (not just \"Subscribe\")\n- Specific benefit of subscribing\n- Single field (email only)\n- Consider incentive (discount, content)\n\n**Copy structure:**\n- Headline: Benefit or curiosity hook\n- Subhead: What they get, how often\n- CTA: Specific action (\"Get Weekly Tips\")\n\n### Lead Magnet Popup\n**Goal**: Exchange content for email\n\n**Best practices:**\n- Show what they get (cover image, preview)\n- Specific, tangible promise\n- Minimal fields (email, maybe name)\n- Instant delivery expectation\n\n### Discount/Promotion Popup\n**Goal**: First purchase or conversion\n\n**Best practices:**\n- Clear discount (10%, $20, free shipping)\n- Deadline creates urgency\n- Single use per visitor\n- Easy to apply code\n\n### Exit Intent Popup\n**Goal**: Last-chance conversion\n\n**Best practices:**\n- Acknowledge they're leaving\n- Different offer than entry popup\n- Address common objections\n- Final compelling reason to stay\n\n**Formats:**\n- \"Wait! Before you go...\"\n- \"Forget something?\"\n- \"Get 10% off your first order\"\n- \"Questions? Chat with us\"\n\n### Announcement Banner\n**Goal**: Site-wide communication\n\n**Best practices:**\n- Top of page (sticky or static)\n- Single, clear message\n- Dismissable\n- Links to more info\n- Time-limited (don't leave forever)\n\n### Slide-In\n**Goal**: Less intrusive engagement\n\n**Best practices:**\n- Enters from corner/bottom\n- Doesn't block content\n- Easy to dismiss or minimize\n- Good for chat, support, secondary CTAs\n\n---\n\n## Design Best Practices\n\n### Visual Hierarchy\n1. Headline (largest, first seen)\n2. Value prop/offer (clear benefit)\n3. Form/CTA (obvious action)\n4. Close option (easy to find)\n\n### Sizing\n- Desktop: 400-600px wide typical\n- Don't cover entire screen\n- Mobile: Full-width bottom or center, not full-screen\n- Leave space to close (visible X, click outside)\n\n### Close Button\n- Always visible (top right is convention)\n- Large enough to tap on mobile\n- \"No thanks\" text link as alternative\n- Click outside to close\n\n### Mobile Considerations\n- Can't detect exit intent (use alternatives)\n- Full-screen overlays feel aggressive\n- Bottom slide-ups work well\n- Larger touch targets\n- Easy dismiss gestures\n\n### Imagery\n- Product image or preview\n- Face if relevant (increases trust)\n- Minimal for speed\n- Optional—copy can work alone\n\n---\n\n## Copy Formulas\n\n### Headlines\n- Benefit-driven: \"Get [result] in [timeframe]\"\n- Question: \"Want [desired outcome]?\"\n- Command: \"Don't miss [thing]\"\n- Social proof: \"Join [X] people who...\"\n- Curiosity: \"The one thing [audience] always get wrong about [topic]\"\n\n### Subheadlines\n- Expand on the promise\n- Address objection (\"No spam, ever\")\n- Set expectations (\"Weekly tips in 5 min\")\n\n### CTA Buttons\n- First person works: \"Get My Discount\" vs \"Get Your Discount\"\n- Specific over generic: \"Send Me the Guide\" vs \"Submit\"\n- Value-focused: \"Claim My 10% Off\" vs \"Subscribe\"\n\n### Decline Options\n- Polite, not guilt-trippy\n- \"No thanks\" / \"Maybe later\" / \"I'm not interested\"\n- Avoid manipulative: \"No, I don't want to save money\"\n\n---\n\n## Frequency and Rules\n\n### Frequency Capping\n- Show maximum once per session\n- Remember dismissals (cookie/localStorage)\n- 7-30 days before showing again\n- Respect user choice\n\n### Audience Targeting\n- New vs. returning visitors (different needs)\n- By traffic source (match ad message)\n- By page type (context-relevant)\n- Exclude converted users\n- Exclude recently dismissed\n\n### Page Rules\n- Exclude checkout/conversion flows\n- Consider blog vs. product pages\n- Match offer to page context\n\n---\n\n## Compliance and Accessibility\n\n### GDPR/Privacy\n- Clear consent language\n- Link to privacy policy\n- Don't pre-check opt-ins\n- Honor unsubscribe/preferences\n\n### Accessibility\n- Keyboard navigable (Tab, Enter, Esc)\n- Focus trap while open\n- Screen reader compatible\n- Sufficient color contrast\n- Don't rely on color alone\n\n### Google Guidelines\n- Intrusive interstitials hurt SEO\n- Mobile especially sensitive\n- Allow: Cookie notices, age verification, reasonable banners\n- Avoid: Full-screen before content on mobile\n\n---\n\n## Measurement\n\n### Key Metrics\n- **Impression rate**: Visitors who see popup\n- **Conversion rate**: Impressions → Submissions\n- **Close rate**: How many dismiss immediately\n- **Engagement rate**: Interaction before close\n- **Time to close**: How long before dismissing\n\n### What to Track\n- Popup views\n- Form focus\n- Submission attempts\n- Successful submissions\n- Close button clicks\n- Outside clicks\n- Escape key\n\n### Benchmarks\n- Email popup: 2-5% conversion typical\n- Exit intent: 3-10% conversion\n- Click-triggered: Higher (10%+, self-selected)\n\n---\n\n## Output Format\n\n### Popup Design\n- **Type**: Email capture, lead magnet, etc.\n- **Trigger**: When it appears\n- **Targeting**: Who sees it\n- **Frequency**: How often shown\n- **Copy**: Headline, subhead, CTA, decline\n- **Design notes**: Layout, imagery, mobile\n\n### Multiple Popup Strategy\nIf recommending multiple popups:\n- Popup 1: [Purpose, trigger, audience]\n- Popup 2: [Purpose, trigger, audience]\n- Conflict rules: How they don't overlap\n\n### Test Hypotheses\nIdeas to A/B test with expected outcomes\n\n---\n\n## Common Popup Strategies\n\n### E-commerce\n1. Entry/scroll: First-purchase discount\n2. Exit intent: Bigger discount or reminder\n3. Cart abandonment: Complete your order\n\n### B2B SaaS\n1. Click-triggered: Demo request, lead magnets\n2. Scroll: Newsletter/blog subscription\n3. Exit intent: Trial reminder or content offer\n\n### Content/Media\n1. Scroll-based: Newsletter after engagement\n2.
