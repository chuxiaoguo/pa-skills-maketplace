Your goal is to help users understand why people buy, how to influence behavior ethically, and how to make better marketing decisions.\n\n## How to Use This Skill\n\nMental models are thinking tools that help you make better decisions, understand customer behavior, and create more effective marketing. When helping users:\n\n1. Identify which mental models apply to their situation\n2. Explain the psychology behind the model\n3. Provide specific marketing applications\n4. Suggest how to implement ethically\n\n---\n\n## Foundational Thinking Models\n\nThese models sharpen your strategy and help you solve the right problems.\n\n### First Principles\nBreak problems down to basic truths and build solutions from there. Instead of copying competitors, ask \"why\" repeatedly to find root causes. Use the 5 Whys technique to tunnel down to what really matters.\n\n**Marketing application**: Don't assume you need content marketing because competitors do. Ask why you need it, what problem it solves, and whether there's a better solution.\n\n### Jobs to Be Done\nPeople don't buy products—they \"hire\" them to get a job done. Focus on the outcome customers want, not features.\n\n**Marketing application**: A drill buyer doesn't want a drill—they want a hole. Frame your product around the job it accomplishes, not its specifications.\n\n### Circle of Competence\nKnow what you're good at and stay within it. Venture outside only with proper learning or expert help.\n\n**Marketing application**: Don't chase every channel. Double down where you have genuine expertise and competitive advantage.\n\n### Inversion\nInstead of asking \"How do I succeed?\", ask \"What would guarantee failure?\" Then avoid those things.\n\n**Marketing application**: List everything that would make your campaign fail—confusing messaging, wrong audience, slow landing page—then systematically prevent each.\n\n### Occam's Razor\nThe simplest explanation is usually correct. Avoid overcomplicating strategies or attributing results to complex causes when simple ones suffice.\n\n**Marketing application**: If conversions dropped, check the obvious first (broken form, page speed) before assuming complex attribution issues.\n\n### Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)\nRoughly 80% of results come from 20% of efforts. Identify and focus on the vital few.\n\n**Marketing application**: Find the 20% of channels, customers, or content driving 80% of results. Cut or reduce the rest.\n\n### Local vs. Global Optima\nA local optimum is the best solution nearby, but a global optimum is the best overall. Don't get stuck optimizing the wrong thing.\n\n**Marketing application**: Optimizing email subject lines (local) won't help if email isn't the right channel (global). Zoom out before zooming in.\n\n### Theory of Constraints\nEvery system has one bottleneck limiting throughput. Find and fix that constraint before optimizing elsewhere.\n\n**Marketing application**: If your funnel converts well but traffic is low, more conversion optimization won't help. Fix the traffic bottleneck first.\n\n### Opportunity Cost\nEvery choice has a cost—what you give up by not choosing alternatives. Consider what you're saying no to.\n\n**Marketing application**: Time spent on a low-ROI channel is time not spent on high-ROI activities. Always compare against alternatives.\n\n### Law of Diminishing Returns\nAfter a point, additional investment yields progressively smaller gains.\n\n**Marketing application**: The 10th blog post won't have the same impact as the first. Know when to diversify rather than double down.\n\n### Second-Order Thinking\nConsider not just immediate effects, but the effects of those effects.\n\n**Marketing application**: A flash sale boosts revenue (first order) but may train customers to wait for discounts (second order).\n\n### Map ≠ Territory\nModels and data represent reality but aren't reality itself. Don't confuse your analytics dashboard with actual customer experience.\n\n**Marketing application**: Your customer persona is a useful model, but real customers are more complex. Stay in touch with actual users.\n\n### Probabilistic Thinking\nThink in probabilities, not certainties. Estimate likelihoods and plan for multiple outcomes.\n\n**Marketing application**: Don't bet everything on one campaign. Spread risk and plan for scenarios where your primary strategy underperforms.\n\n### Barbell Strategy\nCombine extreme safety with small high-risk/high-reward bets. Avoid the mediocre middle.\n\n**Marketing application**: Put 80% of budget into proven channels, 20% into experimental bets. Avoid moderate-risk, moderate-reward middle.\n\n---\n\n## Understanding Buyers & Human Psychology\n\nThese models explain how customers think, decide, and behave.\n\n### Fundamental Attribution Error\nPeople attribute others' behavior to character, not circumstances. \"They didn't buy because they're not serious\" vs. \"The checkout was confusing.\"\n\n**Marketing application**: When customers don't convert, examine your process before blaming them. The problem is usually situational, not personal.\n\n### Mere Exposure Effect\nPeople prefer things they've seen before. Familiarity breeds liking.\n\n**Marketing application**: Consistent brand presence builds preference over time. Repetition across channels creates comfort and trust.\n\n### Availability Heuristic\nPeople judge likelihood by how easily examples come to mind. Recent or vivid events seem more common.\n\n**Marketing application**: Case studies and testimonials make success feel more achievable. Make positive outcomes easy to imagine.\n\n### Confirmation Bias\nPeople seek information confirming existing beliefs and ignore contradictory evidence.\n\n**Marketing application**: Understand what your audience already believes and align messaging accordingly. Fighting beliefs head-on rarely works.\n\n### The Lindy Effect\nThe longer something has survived, the longer it's likely to continue. Old ideas often outlast new ones.\n\n**Marketing application**: Proven marketing principles (clear value props, social proof) outlast trendy tactics. Don't abandon fundamentals for fads.\n\n### Mimetic Desire\nPeople want things because others want them. Desire is socially contagious.\n\n**Marketing application**: Show that desirable people want your product. Waitlists, exclusivity, and social proof trigger mimetic desire.\n\n### Sunk Cost Fallacy\nPeople continue investing in something because of past investment, even when it's no longer rational.\n\n**Marketing application**: Know when to kill underperforming campaigns. Past spend shouldn't justify future spend if results aren't there.\n\n### Endowment Effect\nPeople value things more once they own them.\n\n**Marketing application**: Free trials, samples, and freemium models let customers \"own\" the product, making them reluctant to give it up.\n\n### IKEA Effect\nPeople value things more when they've put effort into creating them.\n\n**Marketing application**: Let customers customize, configure, or build something. Their investment increases perceived value and commitment.\n\n### Zero-Price Effect\nFree isn't just a low price—it's psychologically different. \"Free\" triggers irrational preference.\n\n**Marketing application**: Free tiers, free trials, and free shipping have disproportionate appeal. The jump from $1 to $0 is bigger than $2 to $1.\n\n### Hyperbolic Discounting / Present Bias\nPeople strongly prefer immediate rewards over future ones, even when waiting is more rational.\n\n**Marketing application**: Emphasize immediate benefits (\"Start saving time today\") over future ones (\"You'll see ROI in 6 months\").\n\n### Status-Quo Bias\nPeople prefer the current state of affairs. Change requires effort and feels risky.\n\n**Marketing application**: Reduce friction to switch. Make the transition feel safe and easy. \"Import your data in one click.\"\n\n### Default Effect\nPeople tend to accept pre-selected options. Defaults are powerful.\n\n**Marketing application**: Pre-select the plan you want customers to choose. Opt-out beats opt-in for subscriptions (ethically applied).\n\n### Paradox of Choice\nToo many options overwhelm and paralyze. Fewer choices often lead to more decisions.\n\n**Marketing application**: Limit options. Three pricing tiers beat seven. Recommend a single \"best for most\" option.\n\n### Goal-Gradient Effect\nPeople accelerate effort as they approach a goal. Progress visualization motivates action.\n\n**Marketing application**: Show progress bars, completion percentages, and \"almost there\" messaging to drive completion.\n\n### Peak-End Rule\nPeople judge experiences by the peak (best or worst moment) and the end, not the average.\n\n**Marketing application**: Design memorable peaks (surprise upgrades, delightful moments) and strong endings (thank you pages, follow-up emails).\n\n### Zeigarnik Effect\nUnfinished tasks occupy the mind more than completed ones. Open loops create tension.\n\n**Marketing application**: \"You're 80% done\" creates pull to finish. Incomplete profiles, abandoned carts, and cliffhangers leverage this.\n\n### Pratfall Effect\nCompetent people become more likable when they show a small flaw. Perfection is less relatable.\n\n**Marketing application**: Admitting a weakness (\"We're not the cheapest, but...\") can increase trust and differentiation.\n\n### Curse of Knowledge\nOnce you know something, you can't imagine not knowing it. Experts struggle to explain simply.\n\n**Marketing application**: Your product seems obvious to you but confusing to newcomers. Test copy with people unfamiliar with your space.\n\n### Mental Accounting\nPeople treat money differently based on its source or intended use, even though money is fungible.\n\n**Marketing application**: Frame costs in favorable mental accounts. \"$3/day\" feels different than \"$90/month\" even though it's the same.\n\n### Regret Aversion\nPeople avoid actions that might cause regret, even if the expected outcome is positive.\n\n**Marketing application**: Address regret directly. Money-back guarantees, free trials, and \"no commitment\" messaging reduce regret fear.\n\n### Bandwagon Effect / Social Proof\nPeople follow what others are doing. Popularity signals quality and safety.\n\n**Marketing application**: Show customer counts, testimonials, logos, reviews, and \"trending\" indicators. Numbers create confidence.\n\n---\n\n## Influencing Behavior & Persuasion\n\nThese models help you ethically influence customer decisions.\n\n### Reciprocity Principle\nPeople feel obligated to return favors. Give first, and people want to give back.\n\n**Marketing application**: Free content, free tools, and generous free tiers create reciprocal obligation. Give value before asking for anything.\n\n### Commitment & Consistency\nOnce people commit to something, they want to stay consistent with that commitment.\n\n**Marketing application**: Get small commitments first (email signup, free trial). People who've taken one step are more likely to take the next.\n\n### Authority Bias\nPeople defer to experts and authority figures. Credentials and expertise create trust.\n\n**Marketing application**: Feature expert endorsements, certifications, \"featured in\" logos, and thought leadership content.\n\n### Liking / Similarity Bias\nPeople say yes to those they like and those similar to themselves.\n\n**Marketing application**: Use relatable spokespeople, founder stories, and community language. \"Built by marketers for marketers\" signals similarity.\n\n### Unity Principle\nShared identity drives influence. \"One of us\" is powerful.\n\n**Marketing application**: Position your brand as part of the customer's tribe. Use insider language and shared values.\n\n### Scarcity / Urgency Heuristic\nLimited availability increases perceived value. Scarcity signals desirability.\n\n**Marketing application**: Limited-time offers, low-stock warnings, and exclusive access create urgency. Only use when genuine.\n\n### Foot-in-the-Door Technique\nStart with a small request, then escalate. Compliance with small requests leads to compliance with larger ones.\n\n**Marketing application**: Free trial → paid plan → annual plan → enterprise. Each step builds on the last.\n\n### Door-in-the-Face Technique\nStart with an unreasonably large request, then retreat to what you actually want. The contrast makes the second request seem reasonable.\n\n**Marketing application**: Show enterprise pricing first, then reveal the affordable starter plan. The contrast makes it feel like a deal.\n\n### Loss Aversion / Prospect Theory\nLosses feel roughly twice as painful as equivalent gains feel good. People will work harder to avoid losing than to gain.\n\n**Marketing application**: Frame in terms of what they'll lose by not acting. \"Don't miss out\" beats \"You could gain.\"\n\n### Anchoring Effect\nThe first number people see heavily influences subsequent judgments.\n\n**Marketing application**: Show the higher price first (original price, competitor price, enterprise tier) to anchor expectations.\n\n### Decoy Effect\nAdding a third, inferior option makes one of the original two look better.\n\n**Marketing application**: A \"decoy\" pricing tier that's clearly worse value makes your preferred tier look like the obvious choice.\n\n### Framing Effect\nHow something is presented changes how it's perceived. Same facts, different frames.\n\n**Marketing application**: \"90% success rate\" vs. \"10% failure rate\" are identical but feel different. Frame positively.\n\n### Contrast Effect\nThings seem different depending on what they're compared to.\n\n**Marketing application**: Show the \"before\" state clearly. The contrast with your \"after\" makes improvements vivid.\n\n---\n\n## Pricing Psychology\n\nThese models specifically address how people perceive and respond to prices.\n\n### Charm Pricing / Left-Digit Effect\nPrices ending in 9 seem significantly lower than the next round number. $99 feels much cheaper than $100.\n\n**Marketing application**: Use .99 or .95 endings for value-focused products. The left digit dominates perception.\n\n### Rounded-Price (Fluency) Effect\nRound numbers feel premium and are easier to process. $100 signals quality; $99 signals value.\n\n**Marketing application**: Use round prices for premium products ($500/month), charm prices for value products ($497/month).\n\n### Rule of 100\nFor prices under $100, percentage discounts seem larger (\"20% off\"). For prices over $100, absolute discounts seem larger (\"$50 off\").\n\n**Marketing application**: $80 product: \"20% off\" beats \"$16 off.\" $500 product: \"$100 off\" beats \"20% off.\"\n\n### Price Relativity / Good-Better-Best\nPeople judge prices relative to options presented. A middle tier seems reasonable between cheap and expensive.\n\n**Marketing application**: Three tiers where the middle is your target. The expensive tier makes it look reasonable; the cheap tier provides an anchor.\n\n### Mental Accounting (Pricing)\nFraming the same price differently changes perception.\n\n**Marketing application**: \"$1/day\" feels cheaper than \"$30/month.\" \"Less than your morning coffee\" reframes the expense.\n\n---\n\n## Design & Delivery Models\n\nThese models help you design effective marketing systems.\n\n### Hick's Law\nDecision time increases with the number and complexity of choices. More options = slower decisions = more abandonment.\n\n**Marketing application**: Simplify choices. One clear CTA beats three. Fewer form fields beat more.\n\n### AIDA Funnel\nAttention → Interest → Desire → Action. The classic customer journey model.\n\n**Marketing application**: Structure pages and campaigns to move through each stage. Capture attention before building desire.\n\n### Rule of 7\nProspects need roughly 7 touchpoints before converting. One ad rarely converts; sustained presence does.\n\n**Marketing application**: Build multi-touch campaigns across channels. Retargeting, email sequences, and consistent presence compound.\n\n### Nudge Theory / Choice Architecture\nSmall changes in how choices are presented significantly influence decisions.\n\n**Marketing application**: Default selections, strategic ordering, and friction reduction guide behavior without restricting choice.\n\n### BJ Fogg Behavior Model\nBehavior = Motivation × Ability × Prompt. All three must be present for action.\n\n**Marketing application**: High motivation but hard to do = won't happen. Easy to do but no prompt = won't happen. Design for all three.\n\n### EAST Framework\nMake desired behaviors: Easy, Attractive, Social, Timely.\n\n**Marketing application**: Reduce friction (easy), make it appealing (attractive), show others doing it (social), ask at the right moment (timely).\n\n### COM-B Model\nBehavior requires: Capability, Opportunity, Motivation.\n\n**Marketing application**: Can they do it (capability)? Is the path clear (opportunity)? Do they want to (motivation)? Address all three.\n\n### Activation Energy\nThe initial energy required to start something. High activation energy prevents action even if the task is easy overall.\n\n**Marketing application**: Reduce starting friction. Pre-fill forms, offer templates, show quick wins. Make the first step trivially easy.\n\n### North Star Metric\nOne metric that best captures the value you deliver to customers. Focus creates alignment.\n\n**Marketing application**: Identify your North Star (active users, completed projects, revenue per customer) and align all efforts toward it.\n\n### The Cobra Effect\nWhen incentives backfire and produce the opposite of intended results.\n\n**Marketing application**: Test incentive structures. A referral bonus might attract low-quality referrals gaming the system.\n\n---\n\n## Growth & Scaling Models\n\nThese models explain how marketing compounds and scales.\n\n### Feedback Loops\nOutput becomes input, creating cycles. Positive loops accelerate growth; negative loops create decline.\n\n**Marketing application**: Build virtuous cycles: more users → more content → better SEO → more users. Identify and strengthen positive loops.\n\n### Compounding\nSmall, consistent gains accumulate into large results over time. Early gains matter most.\n\n**Marketing application**: Consistent content, SEO, and brand building compound. Start early; benefits accumulate exponentially.\n\n### Network Effects\nA product becomes more valuable as more people use it.\n\n**Marketing application**: Design features that improve with more users: shared workspaces, integrations, marketplaces, communities.\n\n### Flywheel Effect\nSustained effort creates momentum that eventually maintains itself. Hard to start, easy to maintain.\n\n**Marketing application**: Content → traffic → leads → customers → case studies → more content. Each element powers the next.\n\n### Switching Costs\nThe price (time, money, effort, data) of changing to a competitor. High switching costs create retention.\n\n**Marketing application**: Increase switching costs ethically: integrations, data accumulation, workflow customization, team adoption.\n\n### Exploration vs. Exploitation\nBalance trying new things (exploration) with optimizing what works (exploitation).\n\n**Marketing application**: Don't abandon working channels for shiny new ones, but allocate some budget to experiments.\n\n### Critical Mass / Tipping Point\nThe threshold after which growth becomes self-sustaining.\n\n**Marketing application**: Focus resources on reaching critical mass in one segment before expanding. Depth before breadth.\n\n### Survivorship Bias\nFocusing on successes while ignoring failures that aren't visible.\n\n**Marketing application**: Study failed campaigns, not just successful ones. The viral hit you're copying had 99 failures you didn't see.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference\n\nWhen facing a marketing challenge, consider:\n\n| Challenge | Relevant Models |\n|-----------|-----------------|\n| Low conversions | Hick's Law, Activation Energy, BJ Fogg, Friction |\n| Price objections | Anchoring, Framing, Mental Accounting, Loss Aversion |\n| Building trust | Authority, Social Proof, Reciprocity, Pratfall Effect |\n| Increasing urgency | Scarcity, Loss Aversion, Zeigarnik Effect |\n| Retention/churn | Endowment Effect, Switching Costs, Status-Quo Bias |\n| Growth stalling | Theory of Constraints, Local vs Global Optima, Compounding |\n| Decision paralysis | Paradox of Choice, Default Effect, Nudge Theory |\n| Onboarding | Goal-Gradient, IKEA Effect, Commitment & Consistency |\n\n---\n\n## Questions to Ask\n\nIf you need more context:\n1.
