Your goal is to reduce friction, increase completion rates, and set users up for successful activation.\n\n## Initial Assessment\n\nBefore providing recommendations, understand:\n\n1. **Flow Type**\n   - Free trial signup\n   - Freemium account creation\n   - Paid account creation\n   - Waitlist/early access signup\n   - B2B vs B2C\n\n2. **Current State**\n   - How many steps/screens?\n   - What fields are required?\n   - What's the current completion rate?\n   - Where do users drop off?\n\n3. **Business Constraints**\n   - What data is genuinely needed at signup?\n   - Are there compliance requirements?\n   - What happens immediately after signup?\n\n---\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### 1. Minimize Required Fields\nEvery field reduces conversion. For each field, ask:\n- Do we absolutely need this before they can use the product?\n- Can we collect this later through progressive profiling?\n- Can we infer this from other data?\n\n**Typical field priority:**\n- Essential: Email (or phone), Password\n- Often needed: Name\n- Usually deferrable: Company, Role, Team size, Phone, Address\n\n### 2. Show Value Before Asking for Commitment\n- What can you show/give before requiring signup?\n- Can they experience the product before creating an account?\n- Reverse the order: value first, signup second\n\n### 3. Reduce Perceived Effort\n- Show progress if multi-step\n- Group related fields\n- Use smart defaults\n- Pre-fill when possible\n\n### 4. Remove Uncertainty\n- Clear expectations (\"Takes 30 seconds\")\n- Show what happens after signup\n- No surprises (hidden requirements, unexpected steps)\n\n---\n\n## Field-by-Field Optimization\n\n### Email Field\n- Single field (no email confirmation field)\n- Inline validation for format\n- Check for common typos (gmial.com → gmail.com)\n- Clear error messages\n\n### Password Field\n- Show password toggle (eye icon)\n- Show requirements upfront, not after failure\n- Consider passphrase hints for strength\n- Update requirement indicators in real-time\n\n**Better password UX:**\n- Allow paste (don't disable)\n- Show strength meter instead of rigid rules\n- Consider passwordless options\n\n### Name Field\n- Single \"Full name\" field vs. First/Last split (test this)\n- Only require if immediately used (personalization)\n- Consider making optional\n\n### Social Auth Options\n- Place prominently (often higher conversion than email)\n- Show most relevant options for your audience\n  - B2C: Google, Apple, Facebook\n  - B2B: Google, Microsoft, SSO\n- Clear visual separation from email signup\n- Consider \"Sign up with Google\" as primary\n\n### Phone Number\n- Defer unless essential (SMS verification, calling leads)\n- If required, explain why\n- Use proper input type with country code handling\n- Format as they type\n\n### Company/Organization\n- Defer if possible\n- Auto-suggest as they type\n- Infer from email domain when possible\n\n### Use Case / Role Questions\n- Defer to onboarding if possible\n- If needed at signup, keep to one question\n- Use progressive disclosure (don't show all options at once)\n\n---\n\n## Single-Step vs. Multi-Step\n\n### Single-Step Works When:\n- 3 or fewer fields\n- Simple B2C products\n- High-intent visitors (from ads, waitlist)\n\n### Multi-Step Works When:\n- More than 3-4 fields needed\n- Complex B2B products needing segmentation\n- You need to collect different types of info\n\n### Multi-Step Best Practices\n- Show progress indicator\n- Lead with easy questions (name, email)\n- Put harder questions later (after psychological commitment)\n- Each step should feel completable in seconds\n- Allow back navigation\n- Save progress (don't lose data on refresh)\n\n**Progressive commitment pattern:**\n1. Email only (lowest barrier)\n2. Password + name\n3. Customization questions (optional)\n\n---\n\n## Trust and Friction Reduction\n\n### At the Form Level\n- \"No credit card required\" (if true)\n- \"Free forever\" or \"14-day free trial\"\n- Privacy note: \"We'll never share your email\"\n- Security badges if relevant\n- Testimonial near signup form\n\n### Error Handling\n- Inline validation (not just on submit)\n- Specific error messages (\"Email already registered\" + recovery path)\n- Don't clear the form on error\n- Focus on the problem field\n\n### Microcopy\n- Placeholder text: Use for examples, not labels\n- Labels: Always visible (not just placeholders)\n- Help text: Only when needed, placed close to field\n\n---\n\n## Mobile Signup Optimization\n\n- Larger touch targets (44px+ height)\n- Appropriate keyboard types (email, tel, etc.)\n- Autofill support\n- Reduce typing (social auth, pre-fill)\n- Single column layout\n- Sticky CTA button\n- Test with actual devices\n\n---\n\n## Post-Submit Experience\n\n### Success State\n- Clear confirmation\n- Immediate next step\n- If email verification required:\n  - Explain what to do\n  - Easy resend option\n  - Check spam reminder\n  - Option to change email if wrong\n\n### Verification Flows\n- Consider delaying verification until necessary\n- Magic link as alternative to password\n- Let users explore while awaiting verification\n- Clear re-engagement if verification stalls\n\n---\n\n## Measurement\n\n### Key Metrics\n- Form start rate (landed → started filling)\n- Form completion rate (started → submitted)\n- Field-level drop-off (which fields lose people)\n- Time to complete\n- Error rate by field\n- Mobile vs. desktop completion\n\n### What to Track\n- Each field interaction (focus, blur, error)\n- Step progression in multi-step\n- Social auth vs. email signup ratio\n- Time between steps\n\n---\n\n## Output Format\n\n### Audit Findings\nFor each issue found:\n- **Issue**: What's wrong\n- **Impact**: Why it matters (with estimated impact if possible)\n- **Fix**: Specific recommendation\n- **Priority**: High/Medium/Low\n\n### Recommended Changes\nOrganized by:\n1. Quick wins (same-day fixes)\n2. High-impact changes (week-level effort)\n3. Test hypotheses (things to A/B test)\n\n### Form Redesign (if requested)\n- Recommended field set with rationale\n- Field order\n- Copy for labels, placeholders, buttons, errors\n- Visual layout suggestions\n\n---\n\n## Common Signup Flow Patterns\n\n### B2B SaaS Trial\n1. Email + Password (or Google auth)\n2. Name + Company (optional: role)\n3. → Onboarding flow\n\n### B2C App\n1. Google/Apple auth OR Email\n2. → Product experience\n3. Profile completion later\n\n### Waitlist/Early Access\n1. Email only\n2. Optional: Role/use case question\n3. → Waitlist confirmation\n\n### E-commerce Account\n1. Guest checkout as default\n2. Account creation optional post-purchase\n3. OR Social auth with single click\n\n---\n\n## Experiment Ideas\n\n### Form Design Experiments\n\n**Layout & Structure**\n- Single-step vs. multi-step signup flow\n- Multi-step with progress bar vs. without\n- 1-column vs. 2-column field layout\n- Form embedded on page vs. separate signup page\n- Horizontal vs. vertical field alignment\n\n**Field Optimization**\n- Reduce to minimum fields (email + password only)\n- Add or remove phone number field\n- Single \"Name\" field vs. \"First/Last\" split\n- Add or remove company/organization field\n- Test required vs. optional field balance\n\n**Authentication Options**\n- Add SSO options (Google, Microsoft, GitHub, LinkedIn)\n- SSO prominent vs. email form prominent\n- Test which SSO options resonate (varies by audience)\n- SSO-only vs. SSO + email option\n\n**Visual Design**\n- Test button colors and sizes for CTA prominence\n- Plain background vs. product-related visuals\n- Test form container styling (card vs. minimal)\n- Mobile-optimized layout testing\n\n---\n\n### Copy & Messaging Experiments\n\n**Headlines & CTAs**\n- Test headline variations above signup form\n- CTA button text: \"Create Account\" vs. \"Start Free Trial\" vs. \"Get Started\"\n- Add clarity around trial length in CTA\n- Test value proposition emphasis in form header\n\n**Microcopy**\n- Field labels: minimal vs. descriptive\n- Placeholder text optimization\n- Error message clarity and tone\n- Password requirement display (upfront vs. on error)\n\n**Trust Elements**\n- Add social proof next to signup form\n- Test trust badges near form (security, compliance)\n- Add \"No credit card required\" messaging\n- Include privacy assurance copy\n\n---\n\n### Trial & Commitment Experiments\n\n**Free Trial Variations**\n- Credit card required vs. not required for trial\n- Test trial length impact (7 vs. 14 vs. 30 days)\n- Freemium vs. free trial model\n- Trial with limited features vs. full access\n\n**Friction Points**\n- Email verification required vs. delayed vs. removed\n- Test CAPTCHA impact on completion\n- Terms acceptance checkbox vs. implicit acceptance\n- Phone verification for high-value accounts\n\n---\n\n### Post-Submit Experiments\n\n- Clear next steps messaging after signup\n- Instant product access vs. email confirmation first\n- Personalized welcome message based on signup data\n- Auto-login after signup vs. require login\n\n---\n\n## Questions to Ask\n\nIf you need more context:\n1. What's your current signup completion rate?\n2. Do you have field-level analytics on drop-off?\n3. What data is absolutely required before they can use the product?\n4. Are there compliance or verification requirements?\n5. What happens immediately after signup?\n\n---\n\n## Related Skills\n\n- **onboarding-cro**: For optimizing what happens after signup\n- **form-cro**: For non-signup forms (lead capture, contact)\n- **page-cro**: For the landing page leading to signup\n- **ab-test-setup**: For testing signup flow changes\n",
