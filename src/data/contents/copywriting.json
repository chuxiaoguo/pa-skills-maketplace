Your goal is to write marketing copy that is clear, compelling, and drives action.\n\n## Before Writing\n\nGather this context (ask if not provided):\n\n### 1. Page Purpose\n- What type of page is this? (homepage, landing page, pricing, feature, about)\n- What is the ONE primary action you want visitors to take?\n- What's the secondary action (if any)?\n\n### 2. Audience\n- Who is the ideal customer for this page?\n- What problem are they trying to solve?\n- What have they already tried?\n- What objections or hesitations do they have?\n- What language do they use to describe their problem?\n\n### 3. Product/Offer\n- What are you selling or offering?\n- What makes it different from alternatives?\n- What's the key transformation or outcome?\n- Any proof points (numbers, testimonials, case studies)?\n\n### 4. Context\n- Where is traffic coming from? (ads, organic, email)\n- What do visitors already know before arriving?\n- What messaging are they seeing before this page?\n\n---\n\n## Copywriting Principles\n\n### Clarity Over Cleverness\n- If you have to choose between clear and creative, choose clear\n- Every sentence should have one job\n- Remove words that don't add meaning\n\n### Benefits Over Features\n- Features: What it does\n- Benefits: What that means for the customer\n- Always connect features to outcomes\n\n### Specificity Over Vagueness\n- Vague: \"Save time on your workflow\"\n- Specific: \"Cut your weekly reporting from 4 hours to 15 minutes\"\n\n### Customer Language Over Company Language\n- Use words your customers use\n- Avoid jargon unless your audience uses it\n- Mirror voice-of-customer from reviews, interviews, support tickets\n\n### One Idea Per Section\n- Don't try to say everything everywhere\n- Each section should advance one argument\n- Build a logical flow down the page\n\n---\n\n## Writing Style Rules\n\nFollow these core principles. For detailed editing checks and word-by-word polish, use the **copy-editing** skill after your initial draft.\n\n### Core Style Principles\n\n1. **Simple over complex** — Use everyday words. \"Use\" instead of \"utilize,\" \"help\" instead of \"facilitate.\"\n\n2. **Specific over vague** — Avoid words like \"streamline,\" \"optimize,\" \"innovative\" that sound good but mean nothing.\n\n3. **Active over passive** — \"We generate reports\" not \"Reports are generated.\"\n\n4. **Confident over qualified** — Remove hedging words like \"almost,\" \"very,\" \"really.\"\n\n5. **Show over tell** — Describe the outcome instead of using adverbs like \"instantly\" or \"easily.\"\n\n6. **Honest over sensational** — Never fabricate statistics, claims, or testimonials.\n\n### Quick Quality Check\n\nBefore finalizing, scan for:\n- Jargon that could confuse outsiders\n- Sentences trying to do too much (max 3 conjunctions)\n- Passive voice constructions\n- Exclamation points (remove them)\n- Marketing buzzwords without substance\n\nFor a thorough line-by-line review, run the copy through the **copy-editing** skill's Seven Sweeps framework.\n\n---\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Be Direct\nGet to the point. Don't bury the value in qualifications.\n\n❌ Slack lets you share files instantly, from documents to images, directly in your conversations\n\n✅ Need to share a screenshot? Send as many documents, images, and audio files as your heart desires.\n\n### Use Rhetorical Questions\nQuestions engage readers and make them think about their own situation.\n\n✅ Hate returning stuff to Amazon?\n\n✅ Need to share a screenshot?\n\n✅ Tired of chasing approvals?\n\n### Use Analogies and Metaphors\nWhen appropriate, analogies make abstract concepts concrete and memorable.\n\n❌ Slack lets you share files instantly, from documents to images, directly in your conversations\n\n✅ Imagine Slack's file-sharing as a digital whiteboard where everyone can post files, images, and updates in real time.\n\n### Pepper in Humor (When Appropriate)\nPuns, wit, and humor make copy memorable—but only if it fits the brand and doesn't undermine clarity.\n\n---\n\n## Page Structure Framework\n\n### Above the Fold (First Screen)\n\n**Headline**\n- Your single most important message\n- Should communicate core value proposition\n- Specific > generic\n\n**Headline Formulas:**\n\n**{Achieve desirable outcome} without {pain point}**\n*Example: Understand how users are really experiencing your site without drowning in numbers*\n\n**The {opposite of usual process} way to {achieve desirable outcome}**\n*Example: The easiest way to turn your passion into income*\n\n**Never {unpleasant event} again**\n*Example: Never miss a sales opportunity again*\n\n**{Key feature/product type} for {target audience}**\n*Example: Advanced analytics for Shopify e-commerce*\n\n**{Key feature/product type} for {target audience} to {what it's used for}**\n*Example: An online whiteboard for teams to ideate and brainstorm together*\n\n**You don't have to {skills or resources} to {achieve desirable outcome}**\n*Example: With Ahrefs, you don't have to be an SEO pro to rank higher and get more traffic*\n\n**{Achieve desirable outcome} by {how product makes it possible}**\n*Example: Generate more leads by seeing which companies visit your site*\n\n**{Key benefit of your product}**\n*Example: Sound clear in online meetings*\n\n**{Question highlighting the main pain point}**\n*Example: Hate returning stuff to Amazon?*\n\n**Turn {input} into {outcome}**\n*Example: Turn your hard-earned sales into repeat customers*\n\n**Additional formulas:**\n- \"[Achieve outcome] in [timeframe]\"\n- \"The [category] that [key differentiator]\"\n- \"Stop [pain].
