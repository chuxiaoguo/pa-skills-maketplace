A .docx file is essentially a ZIP archive containing XML files and other resources that you can read or edit. You have different tools and workflows available for different tasks.\n\n## Workflow Decision Tree\n\n### Reading/Analyzing Content\nUse \"Text extraction\" or \"Raw XML access\" sections below\n\n### Creating New Document\nUse \"Creating a new Word document\" workflow\n\n### Editing Existing Document\n- **Your own document + simple changes**\n  Use \"Basic OOXML editing\" workflow\n\n- **Someone else's document**\n  Use **\"Redlining workflow\"** (recommended default)\n\n- **Legal, academic, business, or government docs**\n  Use **\"Redlining workflow\"** (required)\n\n## Reading and analyzing content\n\n### Text extraction\nIf you just need to read the text contents of a document, you should convert the document to markdown using pandoc. Pandoc provides excellent support for preserving document structure and can show tracked changes:\n\n```bash\n# Convert document to markdown with tracked changes\npandoc --track-changes=all path-to-file.docx -o output.md\n# Options: --track-changes=accept/reject/all\n```\n\n### Raw XML access\nYou need raw XML access for: comments, complex formatting, document structure, embedded media, and metadata. For any of these features, you'll need to unpack a document and read its raw XML contents.\n\n#### Unpacking a file\n`python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <office_file> <output_directory>`\n\n#### Key file structures\n* `word/document.xml` - Main document contents\n* `word/comments.xml` - Comments referenced in document.xml\n* `word/media/` - Embedded images and media files\n* Tracked changes use `<w:ins>` (insertions) and `<w:del>` (deletions) tags\n\n## Creating a new Word document\n\nWhen creating a new Word document from scratch, use **docx-js**, which allows you to create Word documents using JavaScript/TypeScript.\n\n### Workflow\n1. **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read [`docx-js.md`](docx-js.md) (~500 lines) completely from start to finish. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** Read the full file content for detailed syntax, critical formatting rules, and best practices before proceeding with document creation.\n2. Create a JavaScript/TypeScript file using Document, Paragraph, TextRun components (You can assume all dependencies are installed, but if not, refer to the dependencies section below)\n3. Export as .docx using Packer.toBuffer()\n\n## Editing an existing Word document\n\nWhen editing an existing Word document, use the **Document library** (a Python library for OOXML manipulation). The library automatically handles infrastructure setup and provides methods for document manipulation. For complex scenarios, you can access the underlying DOM directly through the library.\n\n### Workflow\n1. **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read [`ooxml.md`](ooxml.md) (~600 lines) completely from start to finish. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** Read the full file content for the Document library API and XML patterns for directly editing document files.\n2. Unpack the document: `python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <office_file> <output_directory>`\n3. Create and run a Python script using the Document library (see \"Document Library\" section in ooxml.md)\n4. Pack the final document: `python ooxml/scripts/pack.py <input_directory> <office_file>`\n\nThe Document library provides both high-level methods for common operations and direct DOM access for complex scenarios.\n\n## Redlining workflow for document review\n\nThis workflow allows you to plan comprehensive tracked changes using markdown before implementing them in OOXML. **CRITICAL**: For complete tracked changes, you must implement ALL changes systematically.\n\n**Batching Strategy**: Group related changes into batches of 3-10 changes. This makes debugging manageable while maintaining efficiency. Test each batch before moving to the next.\n\n**Principle: Minimal, Precise Edits**\nWhen implementing tracked changes, only mark text that actually changes. Repeating unchanged text makes edits harder to review and appears unprofessional. Break replacements into: [unchanged text] + [deletion] + [insertion] + [unchanged text]. Preserve the original run's RSID for unchanged text by extracting the `<w:r>` element from the original and reusing it.\n\nExample - Changing \"30 days\" to \"60 days\" in a sentence:\n```python\n# BAD - Replaces entire sentence\n'<w:del><w:r><w:delText>The term is 30 days.</w:delText></w:r></w:del><w:ins><w:r><w:t>The term is 60 days.</w:t></w:r></w:ins>'\n\n# GOOD - Only marks what changed, preserves original <w:r> for unchanged text\n'<w:r w:rsidR=\"00AB12CD\"><w:t>The term is </w:t></w:r><w:del><w:r><w:delText>30</w:delText></w:r></w:del><w:ins><w:r><w:t>60</w:t></w:r></w:ins><w:r w:rsidR=\"00AB12CD\"><w:t> days.</w:t></w:r>'\n```\n\n### Tracked changes workflow\n\n1. **Get markdown representation**: Convert document to markdown with tracked changes preserved:\n   ```bash\n   pandoc --track-changes=all path-to-file.docx -o current.md\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify and group changes**: Review the document and identify ALL changes needed, organizing them into logical batches:\n\n   **Location methods** (for finding changes in XML):\n   - Section/heading numbers (e.g., \"Section 3.2\", \"Article IV\")\n   - Paragraph identifiers if numbered\n   - Grep patterns with unique surrounding text\n   - Document structure (e.g., \"first paragraph\", \"signature block\")\n   - **DO NOT use markdown line numbers** - they don't map to XML structure\n\n   **Batch organization** (group 3-10 related changes per batch):\n   - By section: \"Batch 1: Section 2 amendments\", \"Batch 2: Section 5 updates\"\n   - By type: \"Batch 1: Date corrections\", \"Batch 2: Party name changes\"\n   - By complexity: Start with simple text replacements, then tackle complex structural changes\n   - Sequential: \"Batch 1: Pages 1-3\", \"Batch 2: Pages 4-6\"\n\n3. **Read documentation and unpack**:\n   - **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read [`ooxml.md`](ooxml.md) (~600 lines) completely from start to finish. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** Pay special attention to the \"Document Library\" and \"Tracked Change Patterns\" sections.\n   - **Unpack the document**: `python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <file.docx> <dir>`\n   - **Note the suggested RSID**: The unpack script will suggest an RSID to use for your tracked changes. Copy this RSID for use in step 4b.\n\n4. **Implement changes in batches**: Group changes logically (by section, by type, or by proximity) and implement them together in a single script. This approach:\n   - Makes debugging easier (smaller batch = easier to isolate errors)\n   - Allows incremental progress\n   - Maintains efficiency (batch size of 3-10 changes works well)\n\n   **Suggested batch groupings:**\n   - By document section (e.g., \"Section 3 changes\", \"Definitions\", \"Termination clause\")\n   - By change type (e.g., \"Date changes\", \"Party name updates\", \"Legal term replacements\")\n   - By proximity (e.g., \"Changes on pages 1-3\", \"Changes in first half of document\")\n\n   For each batch of related changes:\n\n   **a. Map text to XML**: Grep for text in `word/document.xml` to verify how text is split across `<w:r>` elements.\n\n   **b. Create and run script**: Use `get_node` to find nodes, implement changes, then `doc.save()`. See **\"Document Library\"** section in ooxml.md for patterns.\n\n   **Note**: Always grep `word/document.xml` immediately before writing a script to get current line numbers and verify text content. Line numbers change after each script run.\n\n5. **Pack the document**: After all batches are complete, convert the unpacked directory back to .docx:\n   ```bash\n   python ooxml/scripts/pack.py unpacked reviewed-document.docx\n   ```\n\n6. **Final verification**: Do a comprehensive check of the complete document:\n   - Convert final document to markdown:\n     ```bash\n     pandoc --track-changes=all reviewed-document.docx -o verification.md\n     ```\n   - Verify ALL changes were applied correctly:\n     ```bash\n     grep \"original phrase\" verification.md  # Should NOT find it\n     grep \"replacement phrase\" verification.md  # Should find it\n     ```\n   - Check that no unintended changes were introduced\n\n\n## Converting Documents to Images\n\nTo visually analyze Word documents, convert them to images using a two-step process:\n\n1. **Convert DOCX to PDF**:\n   ```bash\n   soffice --headless --convert-to pdf document.docx\n   ```\n\n2. **Convert PDF pages to JPEG images**:\n   ```bash\n   pdftoppm -jpeg -r 150 document.pdf page\n   ```\n   This creates files like `page-1.jpg`, `page-2.jpg`, etc.\n\nOptions:\n- `-r 150`: Sets resolution to 150 DPI (adjust for quality/size balance)\n- `-jpeg`: Output JPEG format (use `-png` for PNG if preferred)\n- `-f N`: First page to convert (e.g., `-f 2` starts from page 2)\n- `-l N`: Last page to convert (e.g., `-l 5` stops at page 5)\n- `page`: Prefix for output files\n\nExample for specific range:\n```bash\npdftoppm -jpeg -r 150 -f 2 -l 5 document.pdf page  # Converts only pages 2-5\n```\n\n## Code Style Guidelines\n**IMPORTANT**: When generating code for DOCX operations:\n- Write concise code\n- Avoid verbose variable names and redundant operations\n- Avoid unnecessary print statements\n\n## Dependencies\n\nRequired dependencies (install if not available):\n\n- **pandoc**: `sudo apt-get install pandoc` (for text extraction)\n- **docx**: `npm install -g docx` (for creating new documents)\n- **LibreOffice**: `sudo apt-get install libreoffice` (for PDF conversion)\n- **Poppler**: `sudo apt-get install poppler-utils` (for pdftoppm to convert PDF to images)\n- **defusedxml**: `pip install defusedxml` (for secure XML parsing)",
